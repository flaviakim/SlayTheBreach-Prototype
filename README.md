# SlayTheBreach Prototype

An early prototype for a game, mixing elements from Slay the Spire (the card mechanics) and Into the Breach (the battlefield mechanics).

I developed this for a short time, until I discovered the game [Knights in Tight Spaces](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2315400/Knights_in_Tight_Spaces/), which is basically the same idea.
